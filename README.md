# Example-Notebooks
Example Analytic Notebooks Created by https://github.com/kbvatral for BigData and SmartCities Class

Open the notebooks in [analytics-examples](analytics-examples). The infrastructure-examples which will show you how to access mysql and mongodb are under construction.

We use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) for these examples. The examples also include cases where data is being loaded in from a URL. See the [traffic visualization](https://github.com/vu-bigdata-2020/example-notebooks/blob/master/analytics-examples/traffic_visualization.ipynb) for example.
